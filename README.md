# Hello 👋
I'm Neta, a Full-stack Developer and Ex. product and marketing. In just 9 months, I taught myself how to code and have since built impactful web applications for clients. I am passionate about tech, learning, and leveraging my unique combination of skills to create market-ready, user-friendly digital products.
